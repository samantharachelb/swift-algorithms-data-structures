# Big-O Notation

Big O notation is a mathematical model used to describe the complexity of
algorithms as a function of their input size.

##### Constant Time - O(1)

Execution time remains the same regardless of the size of the input data

##### Linear Time - O(n)

Execution time grows linearly in direct proportion to the size of the input data.

##### Quadratic Time - O(n^2)

Execution time is proportionate to the square of the size of the input data

###### Cubic Time - O(n^3)

Execution time is proportionate to the cube of the size of the input data

###### Quartic Time - O(n^4)

Execution time is proportionate to the 4th power of the size of the input data

###### Polynomial Time - O(n^k) complexity
Nested loops within a method or function should be considered a warning sign when
it comes to time complexity, and these should be avoided all costs.

When you encounter two (2) or more loops that resemble Russian nesting dolls, ask
yourself if the nested iterations are really necessary to solve the problem at hand.

Polynomial time complexity is the result of rushed coding, a lack of time, a lack of expertise, or all three.

##### Logarithmic Time - O(log n)
Execution time increases linearly while the size of the input data grows exponentially.
